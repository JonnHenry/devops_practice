# ðŸš€ My DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning repository!  
This project documents my progress, practice exercises, and mini-projects as I explore the DevOps ecosystem â€” from CI/CD pipelines and containers to infrastructure as code and cloud deployments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Understand and apply **core DevOps principles**.
- Learn how to **automate builds, tests, and deployments**.
- Work with **containers (Docker)** and **orchestration tools (Kubernetes)**.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and security best practices.
